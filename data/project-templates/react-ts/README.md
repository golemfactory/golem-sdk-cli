# Golem + React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a modified version of the [React + TypeScript + Vite](https://vite.new/react-ts) template provided by Vite with the `@golem-sdk/react` package added and some basic instructions on how to connect to yagna.

It's important that you set the `VITE_YAGNA_APPKEY` environment variable to your yagna appkey before running the project. You can find your appkey by running `yagna app-key list` in your terminal.
